# Age-and-Gender-Detection-using-CNN
This project focuses on real-time age and gender detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), trained on a dataset of 23,708 labeled images. The key objective was to build a robust model capable of accurately predicting both age and gender, and to implement it in real-time using the YOLO algorithm and a webcam.





#age model is quite big to upload.
